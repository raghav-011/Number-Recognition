# Number-Recognition
Handwritten digit recognition system not only detects, scanned images of handwritten digits.Handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset is a major project made with the help of Neural Network. It basically detects the scanned images of handwritten digits
Data Augmentation: Using data augmentation (via ImageDataGenerator) is a good practice for improving the model's generalization by artificially increasing the diversity of the training dataset.
Model Architecture: The CNN model architecture appears suitable for the task. Convolutional layers are followed by max-pooling layers, and the final layers are densely connected. This is a common design for image classification tasks.
Training: The model is trained using the fit function with data generated by datagen.flow. 
This allows you to use the augmented data during training. The number of epochs (15 in this case) is a reasonable starting point, but you may need to adjust it based on the training progress and validation performance.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using the evaluate function on the test dataset.
This provides insights into the model's performance on unseen data.
Visualization: The training history is visualized using matplotlib to show the training and validation accuracy over epochs. 
This helps in analyzing the model's learning progress.
Save and Load Model: The model is saved in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) using the save method and loaded using tf.keras.models.load_model.
This is useful for reusing the trained model without retraining.
Prediction and Visualization: The code demonstrates how to make predictions using the loaded model on the first five test images and displays the actual and predicted labels using matplotlib.
